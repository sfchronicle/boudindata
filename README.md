# San Francisco District Attorney charging data

This repo contains data requested by the SF Chronicle data team on arrests presented to, and cases prosecuted by, the San Francisco District Attorney's office from Jan. 2018 through Jan. 2022. You can view the files in the `data` folder's `source` subfolder.

We plan to update this repository with our analysis of the `arrests-presented` and `cases-prosecuted` data when it is ready.
